# Modern Messaging App

## Objective

Design a cross-platform messaging application inspired by Meta Messenger to demonstrate skills at the following:

- Real-time communication
- User authentication
- Modern UI/UX implementation
- Secure environment configuration and deployment

_Note to Maui:_ This requirements document has been modified to cater towards mobile development instead of web development to align it with my upcoming OJT. I thought it best aligned for me so I can both prepare for my OJT and finish a requirement from ALPHA. Two birds one stone, pretty much. Hehe.
